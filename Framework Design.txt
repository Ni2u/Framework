Create a package within 
src/main/java
e.g. com.Ecommerce.Ebay.genericlibrary
organization name.domain name.application name.package name

Create an Interface to declare the constants 
/* key and value which are used in system.set property */
/* Property file path and excel path also remains constant so just store them in  a variable  */
/* Screenshots are always stored in a folder, store that path in a variable*/

Create a class which contains methods to fetch data from external files(property file or excel sheet)
Define the method as static, so that it is directly accesible in other classes, with classname.methodname

Create a Base class, here you can define 2 methods to open browser, take screenshot of failed cases & close browser

Create a Utlilities class, here define static methods to handle webelements, e.g. mouseactions, scrollbar, double click, rightclick, etc

Create a Class with a method to take screenshot.

Note: before we did everything using hardcoding the data, now we just have to pass the varaible in the methods, so that it enables reusability.
